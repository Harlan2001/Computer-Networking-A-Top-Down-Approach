# Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach

Jim Kurose and Keith Ross, authors of the Top-Down Approach, a classic textbook in the field of computer networking, have crafted a course website to go with the textbook, and have posted their own videos of the course, interactive online chapter quizzes,And lab for packet capture analysis using WireShark.The only pity is that there are no hardcore programming assignments for this course, and Stanford's CS144 makes up for that very well.
